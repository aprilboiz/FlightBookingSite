# FlightBookingSite
A web application for searching, booking, and purchasing airplane tickets. This web app is a part of `Software Engineering` course.

## Getting started
### Prequisities
Before you begin, please review the following branches:
- [backend-go](https://github.com/aprilboiz/FlightBookingSite/tree/backend-go): The main backend server, built with Go using the Gin framework.
- [frontend/nextjs](https://github.com/aprilboiz/FlightBookingSite/tree/frontend/nextjs): The main frontend, built with JavaScript using the React framework.
- [document-page](https://github.com/aprilboiz/FlightBookingSite/tree/document-page): The documentation branch (currently not being updated).

**NOTE:** This application is divided into two parts: the frontend and the backend. You will need to clone both repositories to your local machine and follow the installation instructions for each part to run the full application.
A more convenient setup method will be provided later.
